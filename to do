- task: Implement algs for counting # of different countries in a file.


- task: Apply JUnit to test these results, compare to files like "countries in M264A1".

- task: Standardize country names
  idea: using 3-letter international code? (AUS, JAP, USA). 
  And EU? Attention!!! 2-letter code is not the same thing as 3-letter code. 

- task: Data structure of country names.
  idea: External file to store country names (key-values). Parsing this file during program execution, filling the map.
  
- task: Produce several output files, 1 per country. 
  idea: Process input file. Create a file when found a new country name. Example of filename: "output_M264A1_ARG.docx"
